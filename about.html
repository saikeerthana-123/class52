       <h3>Paper was first invented in China around 105 A.D., and was brought to Japan by monks in the sixth century.
            Handmade paper was a luxury item only available to a few, and paper folding in ancient Japan was strictly
            for ceremonial purposes, often religious in nature.<hr><br>

            By the Edo period (1603–1868), paper folding in Japan had become recreational as well as ceremonial,
            often featuring multiple cuts and folds. It came to be regarded as a new form of art that
            was enabled by the advent of paper both mass-produced and more affordable. Written instructions
            for paper folding first appeared in 1797, with Akisato Rito’s Sembazuru Orikata, or “thousand
            crane folding.” In 1845, Adachi Kazuyuki published a more comprehensive compilation of paper folding 
            with Kayaragusa; by the late 1800s, the term for paper folding had morphed from orikata 
            (“folded shapes”) to origami.<hr><br>

            Europe also has a tradition of paper folding that dates back to the twelfth century or 
            before, when the Moors brought a tradition of mathematically based folding to Spain.
            The Spanish further developed paper folding into an artistic practice called papiroflexia
            or pajarita. By the 1800s, kindergarten-aged children in Europe and Japan were learning
             paper folding.</h3></ol><br>
